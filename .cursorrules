# Cursor Rules

## Development Workflow

- Always create a new branch for each task in composer `composer/[feature-name]`
- Run format, lint, and tests to make sure everything is working
- Commit changes only after all checks pass
- Use conventional commit messages

## Stack & Dependencies

- Black for code formatting
- Ruff for linting
- isort for import sorting

## Code Style

- Follow Black code formatting (88 char line length)
- Use type hints for all functions
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Keep docstrings concise but descriptive

## Testing

- Test files mirror source file structure
- Use descriptive test names
- Run tests after every change

## Task Completion Checklist
